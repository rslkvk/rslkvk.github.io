title: About
---

I'm a dedicated software engineer with a passion for building scalable, efficient solutions that drive business growth and streamline user experiences. With a background in both backend and frontend development, I leverage expertise in languages like Kotlin and frameworks like Spring Boot and Angular to deliver robust, user-centered applications.

Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of working on diverse projects ranging from infrastructure improvements to new feature development and system refactoring. I thrive on tackling complex challenges, from managing operational bugs and incidents to optimizing system performance and implementing new requirements. My commitment to continuous learning has equipped me to quickly adapt to new domains, consistently driving quality improvements across cross-functional teams.

In addition to coding, Iâ€™m enthusiastic about collaborating with others to enhance documentation, improve reporting, and explore innovative technologies. My approach balances technical excellence with a deep understanding of business needs, making me a well-rounded contributor to any project.
