In this [Article](https://www.lightercapital.com/blog/causes-of-organizational-silos/) I read about organizational silos - what? why? and how to prevent it? 

After that, I thought a while about the complex topic and the aspect of human being in that whole process. In times of Digitalization it is unalterable to build open-minded teams. The idea of open-mindness should be accepted by the management down to the smallest team member. It's also important to follow the same organizational goals.

> Internal communication has never been more important. 

The companies have different types of competition, that they have to deal with. In addition to the technological change, they must expand their capabilities. The Teams in an organization must think outside a given silo. They have to establish a culture of continuous knowledge building and experience exchange. Building Teams with T-shaped skills are essential. 

> Break through the silos by communicating and knowledge sharing. Even if it's not easy in an virtual work environment.

From the developer view I appreciate the agile working culture very much. It can be an approach for powerful teams - sometimes with Kanban or Scrum. The agile software developing practices, e.g. XP, promote this open-minded culture in the smallest way. Also there are ways to adopt agile approaches at the organizational level.
